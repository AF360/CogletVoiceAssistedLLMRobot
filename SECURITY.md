# Security Policy

If you discover a security issue in this project, please do **not**
open a public issue.

Instead, please contact me via email: **enquiries@acelab.net**.
I will review and respond as soon as possible.

For now there is no authentication / no upload-limits setup for the STT / LLM usage to prevent DoS or similar as the code is intended to be run on a private home network.
